# CPSC330

I saw that some people found this cheatsheet on websites like Course Hero. This was made by me a couple of years ago (I think it was 2021W1). The course might have changed since then, ML is an ever evolving field after all. These notes are only meant for review, they cannot be comparable to the piece of art that is the course textbook. Please use at your own discretion. Please star this repo if you find it helpful!
